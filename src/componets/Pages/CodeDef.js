            Meaning of Coding

            Coding is the process of creating instructions that computers then interpret and follow
             Coding is also known as programming â€“ even though a lot of people would argue there is a slight difference
              between the two,coding and programming still reference the same general process in the long run.
              People who code are known as programmers or developers, and the set of instructions they pass on to a computer
              is called a program.

          These programs can be interpreted by the computer so that the computer can then execute what the programmer 
           intends to make it do. Examples of programs and things built with code are websites, web applications,
          mobile applications, games, and artificial intelligence systems.
